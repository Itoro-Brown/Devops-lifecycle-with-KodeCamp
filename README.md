<h1>Foundational DevOps Concepts</h1>
<h2>Define Devops :</h2> 
<p>DevOps is like a teamwork system that helps people who build software (developers) and people who run the software (operations) work together smoothly and faster.

Imagine you're running a restaurant:

The chefs (developers) cook the meals (write the code).

The waiters and kitchen managers (operations) ensure meals are served properly, the kitchen is clean, and everything is running smoothly (deploy and maintain the software).

In the past, chefs and waiters didn’t talk much—so meals got delayed, mistakes happened, and customers (users) complained.

DevOps is like a system where chefs and waiters plan together, cook together, and serve together — all in harmony. The goal? Serve better meals faster and fix problems quickly.
