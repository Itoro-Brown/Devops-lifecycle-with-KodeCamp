# Devops-lifecycle-with-KodeCamp
Second task from Kodecamp

<h1>Foundational DevOps Concepts</h1>
<h2>1. Define Devops :</h2> 
<p>DevOps is like a teamwork system that helps people who build software (developers) and people who run the software (operations) work together smoothly and faster.

Imagine you're running a restaurant:

The chefs (developers) cook the meals (write the code).

The waiters and kitchen managers (operations) ensure meals are served properly, the kitchen is clean, and everything is running smoothly (deploy and maintain the software).

In the past, chefs and waiters didn’t talk much—so meals got delayed, mistakes happened, and customers (users) complained.

DevOps is like a system where chefs and waiters plan together, cook together, and serve together — all in harmony. The goal? Serve better meals faster and fix problems quickly.

<h2>2. Briefly explain the core principles:</h2>
<p>


### 1. **Collaboration** 🤝

DevOps encourages **strong teamwork** between developers, testers, and operations—breaking silos so everyone works toward the same goal.

### 2. **Automation** ⚙️

Manual tasks like testing, building, and deployment are automated to **save time, reduce errors**, and increase speed>

### 3. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** 🔁

Code changes are **frequently integrated**, tested, and delivered—making sure new features and fixes reach users faster and more reliably.

### 4. **Monitoring and Feedback** 📊

Systems are **monitored in real time**, and feedback is quickly shared with the team to **detect problems early** and improve future releases.

### 5. **Security (DevSecOps)** 🔐

Security is built into every stage of the process—not added at the end—ensuring the software is safe from the start.

### 6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** 🧱

Servers and systems are **configured using code**, making them easy to set up, replicate, and manage consistently.

<h1>Devops Lifecycle Stages</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Planning:</h3><p>This is where the team decides what to build—they gather requirements, set goals, and create a roadmap for the software features or updates.

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Development</h3><p>Developers write the actual code to create features, fix bugs, or improve the product, using tools like Git to track changes.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Building</h3><p>The code is converted into a working software package (like a file or app) using automation tools—this step ensures the software can run properly.

</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Testing</h3><p>The software is checked for bugs and errors using automated and manual tests to make sure it works correctly before it's released</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Release</h3>
    <p>Once tested, the software is approved for delivery, and the final version is made ready for users—usually with a version tag or label.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Deployment</h3>
    <p>The approved software is moved to the live environment (e.g., the real app or website users access), often using automated tools for speed and safety.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Operations</h3>
    <p>The system team keeps the software running smoothly they manage servers, fix issues, and ensure everything is up and running as expected.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Tools are used to watch the software in real time, track performance, catch errors, and gather data to help improve the next version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Expected Outcom</h3>
    <p>The desired result or goal that each stage or action in the DevOps lifecycle is meant to achieve is measurable, predictable, and valuable to both the development team and the end user.</p>
  </li>
  
</ol>
