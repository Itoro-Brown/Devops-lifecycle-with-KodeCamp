<h1>Foundational DevOps Concepts</h1>
<h2>1. Define Devops :</h2> 
<p>DevOps is like a teamwork system that helps people who build software (developers) and people who run the software (operations) work together smoothly and faster.

Imagine you're running a restaurant:

The chefs (developers) cook the meals (write the code).

The waiters and kitchen managers (operations) ensure meals are served properly, the kitchen is clean, and everything is running smoothly (deploy and maintain the software).

In the past, chefs and waiters didn’t talk much—so meals got delayed, mistakes happened, and customers (users) complained.

DevOps is like a system where chefs and waiters plan together, cook together, and serve together — all in harmony. The goal? Serve better meals faster and fix problems quickly.

<h2>2. Briefly explain the core principles:</h2>
<p>
  The **core principles** of a system, philosophy, or framework are its foundational ideas that guide its functioning. Here are some widely recognized core principles across different domains:

### **General Core Principles**  
1. **Integrity** – Acting honestly and ethically.  
2. **Accountability** – Taking responsibility for actions.  
3. **Transparency** – Openness in processes and decisions.  
4. **Fairness** – Impartial and just treatment.  
5. **Respect** – Valuing others’ rights and dignity.  

### **In Business & Leadership**  
- **Customer Focus** – Prioritizing client needs.  
- **Innovation** – Encouraging creativity and improvement.  
- **Sustainability** – Balancing profit with social/environmental responsibility.  

### **In Technology & AI**  
- **Privacy** – Protecting user data.  
- **Bias Mitigation** – Ensuring fairness in algorithms.  
- **Explainability** – Making AI decisions understandable.  

### **In Personal Development**  
- **Growth Mindset** – Believing in continuous learning.  
- **Resilience** – Overcoming challenges.  
- **Self-Discipline** – Staying committed to goals.

<h1>Devops Lifecycle Stages</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Planning:</h3><p>This is where the team decides what to build—they gather requirements, set goals, and create a roadmap for the software features or updates.

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Development</h3><p>Developers write the actual code to create features, fix bugs, or improve the product, using tools like Git to track changes.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Building</h3><p>The code is converted into a working software package (like a file or app) using automation tools—this step ensures the software can run properly.

</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Testing</h3><p>The software is checked for bugs and errors using automated and manual tests to make sure it works correctly before it's released</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Release</h3>
    <p>Once tested, the software is approved for delivery, and the final version is made ready for users—usually with a version tag or label.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Deployment</h3>
    <p>The approved software is moved to the live environment (e.g., the real app or website users access), often using automated tools for speed and safety.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Operations</h3>
    <p>The system team keeps the software running smoothly they manage servers, fix issues, and ensure everything is up and running as expected.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
    <h3>Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Tools are used to watch the software in real time, track performance, catch errors, and gather data to help improve the next version.</p>
  </li>
  
</ol>
